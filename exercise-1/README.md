# Exercise-1

As described in the [git-basics chapter](https://info201.github.io/git-basics.html), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine.

Then, in the space below, put your favorite quote in a block quote, and provide a link to a website that provides additional information about the quote. When you push your changes back up to GitHub, you will see the rendered markdown file.

See `complete` branch for an example.

`“Hey," said Shadow. "Huginn or Muninn, or whoever you are."
The bird turned, head tipped, suspiciously, on one side, and it stared at him with bright eyes.
"Say 'Nevermore,'" said Shadow.
"Fuck you," said the raven.”``
